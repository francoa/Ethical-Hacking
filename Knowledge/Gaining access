Gaining access

** To Servers:
	- Start with information gathering, find open ports, installed services, OS version, applications, etc.

- Using metasploitable2 for testing
- Information gathering:
	- nmap
- Metasploit
	- In kali: run metasploit
	- use exploit
	- show options
	- set option1 value1
	- exploit
- For reverse shells it is useful to listen in port 80, so as to not get filtered by firewalls

** To Clients:
	- Malware, phishing, trojans, social engineering, information gathering
	- Require the user to do something

*** Veil framework:
	- Generating backdoors
	- Evasion -> generates backdoors
	- Ordnance -> generates payload, reverse shell, etc.
	- Meterpreter -> runs in memory (hard to detect, doesn't leave lots of footprints), allows to migrate to system processes.
	- Signature checks of AV. Don't check your backdoor with VirusTotal cause they share their results. Use nodistribute instead?
	- Listening to reverse shell.
		- msfconsole; use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD ...; 

*** Delivery of backdoor
	- Spoof an update
	- Requires DNS spoofing + evilgrade
	- evilgrade - `show modules` - shows programs
	- ARP poisoning + DNS spoofing

*** Delivery of backdoor 2
