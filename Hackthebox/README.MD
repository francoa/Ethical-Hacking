In the **Notes-Retired-Machines** folder, you'll find some of the notes I've taken from tutorials, writeups and walktrhoughs I've come across while learning. Most of them from the Ippsec channel in Youtube. Go check it out!

In the **Owned-Writeups** folder, you'll find my own writeups on boxes I've been able to own. Most of the writeups are not uploaded yet, since I'm waiting for them to get retired to post them.
