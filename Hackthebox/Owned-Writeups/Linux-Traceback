Pretty easy one
Nmap showed only port 80 and 22
In index.html, port 80, there was a message.
By inspecting the source, I saw a comment and the name of the author
	- Some of the best web shells that you might need
	- Xh4H
Browsing that, I found a github page with several webshells
Added the files to a wordlist and ran dirbuster
10.10.10.181/smevk.php found
In github, default config for smevk.php was admin admin
Logged in
Launch a reverse shell
User is webadmin, not the one we are looking for. sysadmin is the real user
# sudo -l
	- (sysadimn) NOPASSWD: /home/sysadmin/luvit

# sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit -e 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' opens a a shell as sysadmin
If you see the help in luvit, it's a lua interpreter, so we can easily get out of that (GTFObins)

From linpeas, there are some writeable files in /etc/update-motd.d as sysadmin
This are the MOTD, the text that appears when a user logs in

So far, we haven't logged in with any user.
With webadmin, I run # ssh-keygen
I copy the resulting key-pair to my local environment and add the public key to authorized_keys in webadmin/.ssh
Then ssh -i id_rsa webadmin@10.10.10.181

To have a reverse shell as root, just add (as sysadmin) echo "reverse shell command" >> /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
